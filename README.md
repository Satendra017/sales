AI Sales Lead Validator

Overview

The AI Sales Lead Validator is a Streamlit-based web application that helps businesses analyze and predict the conversion probability of sales leads using machine learning. The system allows users to:

Scrape and display sales leads data.

Predict conversion probabilities using a pre-trained KNN model.

Take user feedback via speech recognition.

Manually approve or reject scraped data.

Add new sales leads manually.

Features

âœ… Sales Lead Scraping & Display â€“ Scrapes sales lead data and presents it in a table format.
âœ… Machine Learning Predictions â€“ Uses a trained KNN model to predict conversion probabilities.
âœ… Voice Interaction â€“ AI assistant provides verbal feedback and listens to user responses.
âœ… Manual Data Approval â€“ Users can approve or reject sales leads via voice commands or buttons.
âœ… New Lead Addition â€“ Allows users to add new sales leads manually via an interactive form.
âœ… Real-time Updates â€“ Newly added leads are automatically analyzed and displayed with predictions.
